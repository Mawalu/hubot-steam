#Hubot steam
A hubot adapter for the steam network.
##Installation
Add `hubot-steam` to your package.json dependencies and run
```
npm install
```
of, if you didn't modify ./bin/hubot, it should do this automatically when you start hubot the 
next time.
##Configuration
By now there are only two parameters available. 

* `HUBOT_STEAM_NAME` The steam account name of the bot account.
* `HUBOT_STEAM_PASSWORD` The password for the steam account.

At the moment it is not possible to use an account which is protected by steamguard, but I am 
allready working on that. It is strongly recomended to creat a new account for your bot!

improved and extended by me.
