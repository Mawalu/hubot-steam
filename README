Well, it's a first mini-commit for my steam adapter.

It works, but user/pwd are hardcoded.

node-steam is Required for this adapter to work.

To get it running: Create a steam account for your bot.
Set the username/password in steam.coffee.

If anyone friends your hubot, hubot will friend him back.

Enjoy. If I get to it, i'll update it.
